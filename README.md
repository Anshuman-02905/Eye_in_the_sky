## Problem Statement
In India, the government and other independent private companies depend upon survey teams and remote sensing methods to produce ground reports on several domains. The reports must be assessed by a team who must be physically present on-ground or on-site to perform the required analysis. This induces expense and bias in the production of these ground reports. Our research aims to produce on-demand or monthly or yearly ground reports using Deep Learning analysis on satellite imagery. We propose to automate the entire process by building a model through which new images can be passed and the required inferences can be obtained. The stakeholders involved would highly benefit from the algorithm as it would lead to better response retrieval for the image passed and would rid us of bias. We imply many advanced convolution neural networks (CNNs) which are used for Deep Learning to analyze these geospatial and satellite images.
